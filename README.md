A Model Training To Cyberbullying Detection With Some Classification Techniques Of Data Mining

I have developed to this project for the Introduction to Data Mining course. Firstly, I decided the dataset which is Turkish Cyberbullying from the data science platform kaggle.com. After that, I applied some preprocessing operation, thereafter I employed Bag of Words technique through Scikit-Learn tool. Finally, I used Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree classifiers and AdaBoost, Random Forest ensemble methods. As a result, I got the best accuracy from Decision Tree Classifier as 89% and, the others ranged in 84% and 87%.
